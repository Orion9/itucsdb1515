Change Log
----------

When you first enter the site, you will realize that there is a column showing the last five operations done in the site.
When an authenticated user perform an operation, last five operations always be showing up in main page. If that is the
first time user entered the site, by checking both columns in the home page and examining last changes user can get an
idea of the website. On the other hand if it is not user's first time, then instead of checking all tables to see what changed;
user can simply look on the last changes column.

       Last Changes Column in Home Page

Change Log serves two main ideas; to track down which operations are done and by whom, and by some chance if database
operations fails as a means of debugging. In the home page we represent only the last five changes, but in manager screen
all logs are stored.

    .. figure:: furkan_pics/change_log_main.png

       :alt: change log

       All Stored Log Data

As can seen in the above figure, logs are all divided into 3 different columns; first column to explain what is done,
second to tell by whom and the third for date of the operation. In the main change log it is easy to differentiate users
from the description because table structure make their positions clear. But in the home page in last changes column,
in some cases it may not be easy to see user in first glance. So to emphasize some keywords in log like user, we used bold
font for users.

Country
-------

All country data are stored in database.So we have basically a front page to represent or change this data. First page is simply
on /country route and its purpose to represent data we have in an elegant way and providing some functionality.

       :alt: country front page

        Front Page For Countries

As can seen in the above figure, data simply divided into 3 columns; country name, country's capital and the population.
Also table is striped table meaning that if you have your cursor over a row, that row will be focused and will be easy to see.
There are location markers next to city and country names, as you can guess by clicking those icons user can see location
of clicked name on GoogleMaps Api.

       Country Locations

In this example I have clicked on Paris and the results can be seen as in the figure above. Right after clicking the location
marker, a modal with location map shows up by taking all the focus.
Also at the top of the table you can see "Manage" button. By clicking this button, if user have sufficient permission, user
will be directed to manager page for countries where he/she can change data.

Second page for both representing and changing data for countries is on the /manager/country route
and only users with sufficient permissions can locate the page. In this page, all data represented in data table structure.
Also any columns for country such as id are shown here while it was not showing in the front page.

the other for changing the data. First page is to represent data and any user can locate this page on route /matches.

referee and stadium. Date, simply as the name says, shows the date when the match took place and formatted as D/M/Y. Results
column shows teams and their scores with scores emphasized. And so stadium shows which stadium match took place and referee
shows who was the referee in the match.

After user clicked "Manage Button" on the top of table, user will be directed to /manager/matches page if he/she have
sufficient permission.

Second page is for both representation and modifying data and can be accessed only by authenticated users.
