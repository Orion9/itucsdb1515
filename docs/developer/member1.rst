=====================================
Front End Design
----------------
Application user interface uses Bootstrap framework for responsive UI, jQuery framework for much more dynamic design and
DataTables framework for glorious tables. Main aim for the design was simplicity. Any type of user could easily use the
application without losing its way. Thus, color scheme selection and content placement has been done accordingly.
On top of the Bootstrap, a hand written CSS file has been added to extend both its responsivity and design.

Different enhancements has been applied on both *front body* and *manager body* classes. *Pagination* has been fixed, columns
in front page has been hidden in *smaller screens*. Also **navigation bar** and **sidebar** has been changed in *smaller screens*.
   .. code-block:: css

      .sidebar {
        display: none;
      }

      @media (min-width: 768px) {
        .sidebar {
            background-color: #f5f5f5;
            position: fixed;
            top: 31px;
            left: 0;
            bottom: 0;
            display: block;
            padding: 20px;
        }
      }

For show **sidebar** minimum *screen width* has been selected as **768px**. If *screen width* is smaller than this, **sidebar**
will be hidden and a **navigation bar** on top would be displayed. Both **navigation bar** and **sidebar** uses *Jinja2*'s
variable switching ability. Both front and manager layout contains a *Jinja2* block that contains all menu items.
    .. code-block:: python

      {% set navigation_bar = [
        ('/manage', 'main', 'Main'),
        ('/manage/people', 'people', 'People'),
        ('/manage/penalties', 'penalties', 'Penalties'),
        ('/manage/popularity', 'popularity', 'Popularity'),
        ('/manage/cities', 'cities', 'Cities'),
        ('/manage/teams', 'teams', 'Teams'),
        ('/manage/team_stats', 'team_stats', 'Team Statistics'),
        ('/manage/players', 'players', 'Players'),
        ('/manage/sponsorships', 'sponsorships', 'Sponsorships'),
        ('/manage/stadiums', 'stadiums', 'Stadiums'),
        ('/manage/countries', 'countries', 'Countries'),
        ('/manage/tournaments', 'tournaments', 'Tournaments'),
        ('/manage/matches', 'matches', 'Matches'),
        ('/manage/leagues', 'leagues', 'Leagues')] -%}
      {% set active_page = active_page|default('main') -%}

This code block creates links, names, alternatives and also determines which page is active.
Design also gives extreme importance to the dynamism. To create dynamic pages, design utilizes jQuery and JavaScript's
AJAX capabilities. All submit operations handled with an AJAX handler that written for operation-specific purposes.
This will be discussed in later parts.

Configuration File
------------------
Configuration file hs been written in order to maintain simplicity when implementing other methods.
All configuration methods has been stored in **config.py** file. It contains two methods one for parsing
database parameters and another one is for creating a connection to database.

   .. code-block:: python

      def db_connect():
        # Connecting db by checking VCAP credentials. By courtesy of Turgut Hoca. #
        VCAP_SERVICES = os.getenv('VCAP_SERVICES')
        if VCAP_SERVICES is not None:
            dsn = get_elephantsql_dsn(VCAP_SERVICES)
        else:
            # Change this line according to your local db credentials #
            dsn = """user='postgres' password='password'
                                   host='localhost' port=5432 dbname='itucsdb1515'"""

        try:
            db_connection = connect(dsn)
            return db_connection
        except Error as error:
            print(error)
            return None


First this method checks for OS environment for environment variable called ''**VCAP_SERVICES**''. If this variable exists
then it takes and parses the connection information from deployment server. If it is not exists then it works on **localhost**,
thus it takes local information to connect the database.

REST API Skeleton
-----------------
All operations have done through the **REST API** that has written from scratch. The power of **REST API** is flexibility. It
creates an abstract layer for all operations that needed to be done. By this way, without using any interface all operations
can be completed through API. Application's user interface utilizes this ability and uses **AJAX handlers** for completing operations.
API can be accessible through ``/api`` route. If user send request to the route ``http://localhost/api`` the answer will be in
**JSON** format. All information in REST APIs are handled in JSON format. This makes it easier for AJAX handlers to understand data.

      .. code-block:: bash

            $ curl http://localhost:5000/api

            {
                  "welcome_message": "Welcome to the DBall API v1.0"
            }

    Example API usage.

Get Operation
+++++++++++++
API can both pull and push information to the application. To pull information, users should use specific routes that has been designed
for that record. Users can either pull information for specific ID or they can pull all the records that has been stored in
database. All responses will be in JSON format. **GET** routes are only allows *GET* method. Thus if it encounters with a *POST*
request it would give a 405 error.

      .. code-block:: bash

            $ curl http://localhost:5000/api/<record_name>/<id>

      Example request for **GET** operation.

Add Operation
+++++++++++++
To complete add operation through API, user must be logged in. In other words, it should have a **session** in computer.
This prevents unauthorized users to alter records. After login operation user can add using ``/api/<record_name>/add``
route to add new record to the system. It only accepts *POST* method.

      .. code-block:: bash

            $ curl -X POST -d "{...}" http://localhost:5000/api/<record_name>/add

      Example request for **ADD** operation.

Update Operation
++++++++++++++++
Again to complete update operation user should be logged in. After logged in, user can use ``/api/<record_name>/update``
route to update records that have been stored in database. It only accepts *POST* method.

      .. code-block:: bash

            $ curl -X POST -d "{...}" http://localhost:5000/api/<record_name>/update

      Example request for **UPDATE** operation.

Delete Operation
++++++++++++++++
After login operation user can delete records on database from the route ```/api/<record_name>/delete``.
It only accepts *POST* method.
      .. code-block:: bash

            $ curl -X POST -d "{...}" http://localhost:5000/api/<record_name>/delete

      Example request for **DELETE** operation.
