Database Operations for Each Entity
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
For each database operations of entities, appropriate SQL queries are written and
they are executed within the functions in the .py class files.

Team
----

Team tuples have three columns; id, name and coach. Coach is a foreign key to the person table.

Get Team By Id
++++++++++++++

In order to get teams and use them in functions, the primary key(team_id) is used.
A dictionary is created with the chosen team's data and it is returned.
You can see how this operation is done in the code below:

    .. code-block:: python

      def get_team_by_id(self, get_id=None):
        connection = db_connect()
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        if get_id is not None:
            query = """SELECT t.team_id, t.team_name, t.team_couch,person.person_name
                       FROM team AS t
                       LEFT OUTER JOIN person ON person.person_id = t.team_couch
                       WHERE team_id = %s"""
            try:
                cursor.execute(query, (get_id,))
                connection.commit()

                data = cursor.fetchone()
                if data is not None:
                    self.id = data[0]
                    self.name = data[1]
                    self.couch = data[2]
                    cursor.close()
                    connection.close()
                    return self

                else:
                    cursor.close()
                    connection.close()
                    return None

            except connection.Error as error:
                print(error)
                connection.rollback()

        else:
            query = """SELECT team.team_id, team.team_name,team.team_couch,person.person_id,person.person_name FROM team
                       LEFT OUTER JOIN person ON person.person_id = team.team_couch"""
            try:
                cursor.execute(query, (get_id,))
                connection.commit()

                array = []
                data = cursor.fetchall()
                for team in data:
                    array.append(
                        {
                            'id': team[0],
                            'name': team[1],
                            'couch': team[4]
                        }
                        )
                cursor.close()
                connection.close()

                return array

            except connection.Error as error:
                print(error)
                connection.rollback()


Add Team To Database
++++++++++++++++++++

In order to add team tuples to the database, INSERT INTO queries are used and executed.
The foreign keys are selected from the referenced tables by id.You can see it in the code below:

    .. code-block:: python

      def add_to_db(self):
        connection = db_connect()
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        select_person = """SELECT person_id FROM person WHERE person_name = %s"""



        # query to add given team tuple to database
         query = """INSERT INTO team (team_name, team_couch)
                        VALUES (%s, %s)"""

        try:
            cursor.execute(select_person, (self.couch,))
            connection.commit()
            new_person = cursor.fetchone()

            cursor.execute(query, (self.name, new_person))
            connection.commit()
            status = True

        except connection.Error as error:
            print(error)
            connection.rollback()
            status = False

        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        return status


Delete Team From Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
The team to be deleted is selected by id and deleted by using DELETE FROM query.
You can see it in the code below:

    .. code-block:: python

      def delete_from_db(self):
        connection = db_connect()
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        query = """DELETE FROM team WHERE team_id = %s"""

        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.id,))
            connection.commit()
            status = True

        except connection.Error as error:
            print(error)
            connection.rollback()
            status = False

        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        return status


Update Team
+++++++++++
The team to be updated is selected by id and updated by the UPDATE query. Just like in add operation,the foreign
keys are selected from the referenced table by id.
You can see it in the code below:

    .. code-block:: python

      def update_db(self):
        connection = db_connect()
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        select_person = """SELECT person_id FROM person WHERE person_name = %s"""

        query = """UPDATE team
                   SET team_name=%s, team_couch=%s
                   WHERE team_id=%s"""

        try:
            cursor.execute(select_person, (self.couch,))
            connection.commit()
            person_id = cursor.fetchone()

            cursor.execute(query, (self.name, person_id, self.id))
            connection.commit()
            status = True
        except connection.Error as error:
            print(error)
            connection.rollback()
            status = False

        cursor.close()
        connection.close()
        return status

Player
------

Player tuples have four columns; id,name, team and number of goals. Team is a foreign key to the teams table.

Get Player By Id
++++++++++++++++

In order to get players and use them in functions, the primary key(player_id) is used.
A dictionary is created with the chosen player's data and it is returned.
You can see how this operation is done in the code below:

    .. code-block:: python

      def get_player_by_id(self, get_id=None):
        connection = db_connect()
        cursor = connection.cursor()

        if get_id is not None:
            query = """SELECT *
                                FROM player
                                JOIN team ON team.team_id = player.player_team
                                WHERE player_id = %s"""
            try:
                cursor.execute(query, (get_id,))
                connection.commit()
                data = cursor.fetchone()
                if data is not None:
                    self.id = data[0]
                    self.name = data[1]
                    self.goals = data[3]
                    self.team = data[5]

                    cursor.close()
                    connection.close()
                    return self

                else:
                    cursor.close()
                    connection.close()
                    return None

            except connection.Error as error:
                print(error)
                connection.rollback()

        else:
            query = """SELECT * FROM player
                                JOIN team ON team.team_id = player.player_team"""
            try:
                cursor.execute(query)
                connection.commit()
            except connection.Error as error:
                print(error)
                connection.rollback()

            array = []
            data = cursor.fetchall()

            for player in data:
                array.append(
                    {

                    }
                )
            print(array)
